								<h4 class="major">Project Overview:</h4>
								<p>Influenza, commonly known as the flu, can have severe consequences, especially for vulnerable populations. This project focuses on improving the accuracy of predicting H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccination rates by considering individual backgrounds and behaviors. By developing a robust predictive model that incorporates various factors like demographics, socio-economic status, medical history, and attitudes towards vaccination, the goal is to provide actionable insights for public health professionals and policymakers. Ultimately, this project aims to reduce the burden of influenza and enhance community well-being.</p>
								<h5 class="major">Achievements and Insights:</h5>
								<p> The project successfully developed a predictive model, with the GradientBoostingClassifier emerging as the best performer, achieving a train accuracy of 79.3% and a test accuracy of 78.7%. While the desired 80% accuracy level wasn't reached, extensive efforts were made to refine the models. The dataset, while providing intriguing insights, exhibited biases due to overrepresented demographics. Recommendations include collecting a more diverse dataset, addressing model biases, investigating predictors like race, incorporating external data, and transparently communicating limitations. This project serves as a testament to the commitment to data-driven solutions in the pursuit of public health optimization.<a href="https://github.com/FirenziaF/PREDICTION-OF-THE-UPTAKE-OF-SEASONAL-VACCINES-MACHINE-LEARNING-MODEL/blob/main/README.md">Click here to access the full project on Github</a></p>

								<span class="image main"><a href="https://github.com/FirenziaF/KC-REALSTATE-ANALYSIS-AND-MODELLING"><img src="images/KC1.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>
								<h4 class="major">Project Overview:</h4>
								<p> In this real estate investment analysis project, our primary objective was to harness the available data to enhance decision-making processes for potential investors in the King County real estate market. We leveraged the provided dataset, which contained comprehensive information on various properties, and embarked on a multifaceted exploration. Our key focus was on constructing a robust multiple linear regression model to predict house prices. To achieve this, we meticulously investigated factors that significantly influenced property values, including waterfront location, the relationship between the number of bathrooms and bedrooms, the overall grade of homes, house condition, as well as the number of floors and basement size. This project was initiated with a clear goal in mind: to empower investors with actionable insights that would enable them to minimize risk while maximizing their return on investment.</p>
								<h5 class="major">Achievements and Insights:</h5>
								<p> Throughout the course of this analysis, several noteworthy achievements and insights emerged. First and foremost, we discovered that the size of living spaces (sqft_living) was a paramount factor driving house prices upward. Homes with a waterfront location consistently commanded higher prices, indicating the desirability of such properties among buyers. An interesting observation was that a significant portion of houses in King County exhibited very good condition, which positively correlated with higher prices. Additionally, our findings revealed that renovations could substantially boost tenant attraction and property values. Based on our analysis, we proposed several recommendations, such as considering proximity to water, improving the grade of houses, increasing the number of floors, adding bedrooms, and expanding the basement size, all of which were identified as effective strategies to enhance property value. This project culminated in equipping real estate investors with valuable insights and actionable recommendations to navigate the King County market with confidence and foresight.<a href="https://github.com/FirenziaF/KC-REALSTATE-ANALYSIS-AND-MODELLING">Click here to access the full project on Github</a></p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Ways_To_Make_A_Career_Change.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Transitioning from a bachelor's degree in Population Health to the world of Data Science has been a thrilling journey, filled with both challenges and excitement. In the past six months, I immersed myself in an intensive boot camp at Moringa School, gaining essential technical skills and knowledge to thrive in this dynamic field. This blog post encapsulates my personal experience, from embracing the boot camp's challenges to bridging the gap between Data Science and my passion for public health, especially in the oncology domain. With a particular focus on machine learning, data storytelling, statistics, and the power of data, I'm eager to create a positive impact on communities and society at large. My vision extends beyond personal growth, as I aspire to collaborate with healthcare organizations and research institutions, utilizing data-driven insights to tackle health challenges and improve patient outcomes. This transition has equipped me with the tools to drive evidence-based strategies that promote health equity and enhance well-being, demonstrating the profound potential of data in the field.<a href="https://medium.com/@florencenguuni/embracing-data-science-my-journey-from-population-health-to-making-an-impact-45e4228f940a">Click here to access the blog on Medium</a></p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/multiple.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>In this project, I used the Combined Cycle Power Plant dataset from Kaggle to build a model for predicting power plant energy output. I started by preparing the data, splitting it into a training set and a test set. Then, I trained the model to learn patterns in the training data using Multiple Linear Regression. After training, I applied the model to make predictions on the test data, achieving an impressive accuracy of about 93.04%. To visualize the model's performance, I created a scatter plot comparing predicted and actual values. Overall, this project demonstrates the model's strong predictive capabilities in estimating energy output, providing a solid foundation for potential improvements and applications in the future.<a href="https://medium.com/@florencenguuni/embracing-data-science-my-journey-from-population-health-to-making-an-impact-45e4228f940a">Click here to access the blog on Medium</a></p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/ensembling-methods-in-ml.webp" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Ensemble learning is a powerful machine learning technique that combines predictions from multiple models to enhance accuracy and reliability. It leverages the collective wisdom of diverse models, effectively mitigating overfitting and improving overall performance. This approach, inspired by the "wisdom of the crowd," is valuable in scenarios where individual models may have limitations. Ensemble methods like Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, and Bagging are popular examples, offering ways to combine the strengths of different models to achieve more accurate predictions. Ensemble learning plays a pivotal role in various machine learning tasks, from classification to regression, and is especially effective when the base models are diverse and amenable to parallel training.<a href="https://medium.com/@florencenguuni/ensemble-methods-87833619699e">Click here to access the blog on Medium</a></p>
